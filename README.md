Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial was a company that had an end goal of securing communications from customers into their web client. Their main objective was to protect their client data and financial information.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I felt as if some of their code was too open and susceptive to out of the program hackers. It is important to code securely because of various attacks malicious agents can perform. Specifically XSS attacks if the inputs aren't validated, can show personal information of customers.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found the objective of going line by line very tedious. I feel as if everyone looking for a specific vulnerability feels the same way because of how many lines of code there can potentially be.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
As cliche as it sounds, I covered the vulnerabilities and any exploits I thought could be taken advantage of by hackers. A big thing I used was input validation on the code.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I included session management and identity management controls on the server-side to minimize the risk that a user session is hijacked or that credentials are illegitimately used. In the future, I would have used multi-factor authentication because it provides greater security, especially when combined with secure password storage and recovery mechanisms.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Out of everything, I would continue to use Input Validation because with it, it deflects most security vulnerabilities.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
Yes and No. If the employer asked for any projects in school or such but I do not believe this would be a professional project as it's technically not in my career.
